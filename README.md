## INDUCTEES

COMING SOON

## NOMINATIONS

To make a nomination please submit a PR including `.md` file in `/INDUCTEES` with the following:

- An example request / response
- A writeup explaining why the API design in question is so AMAZING.

Nomination will be evaluated by a committee of one and accepted if deemed acceptable.

### GUIDELINES

- Remove all API keys, PII and other sensitive data from your request/response examples!
- These must be API's that are either "public" or accessible via license to software (EG: they are meant to be integrated with external systems; no "internal only / mom & pop / BFFE" API's).
- We are only evaluating on the API DESIGN. API reliablity, uptime, one-off bugs, etc are too hard to quanitify.
- This is about celebrating the "Best of the Worst".  Your nomination should highlight the amazingness of the API. No "personal" attacks or name calling.
