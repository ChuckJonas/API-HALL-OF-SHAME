# API-HALL-OF-SHAME
Celebrating the best of the worst in API design!

*Nominations Welcome*

## INDUCTEES
COMING SOON

## NOMINATIONS

To make a nomination please submit a PR including `.md` file in `/INDUCTEES` with the following:

- An example request / response
- A writeup explaining why the API design in question is so AMAZING.

Nomination will be evaluated by a committee of one and accepted if deemed acceptable.

### GUIDELINES

- Remove all API keys, PII and other sensitive data from your request/response examples!
- These must be API's that are either "public" or as part of a licensed software (EG: they are meant to be called by external systems; no "internal only / mom & pop" API's).
- We are only evaluating on the API Design. API reliablity, uptime, etc is too hard to quanitify.
- This is about celebrating the "Best of the Worst".  Your entree should highlight the amazingness of the API. No "personal" attacks or name calling.
